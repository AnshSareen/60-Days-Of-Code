### üìù Personal Insights

- **Candy (135)**: Had to think for a while‚Äîgood greedy problem. Solved it using a double pass: left to right and right to left, ensuring each child gets more candies than a lower-rated neighbor.

- **Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array (448)**: To handle efficiently, I used a boolean array where each index is marked `true` if the number is present. This allowed identifying the missing numbers cleanly in a single pass.

- **Reverse String (344)**: Easy problem. Just needed to swap characters from both ends toward the center.

- **Product of Array Except Self (238)**: Initially solved using division, but then had to revise after learning division wasn‚Äôt allowed. Took a hint and learned about the prefix-suffix approach‚Äînew and insightful for me.

- **Maximum Subarray (53)**: Identified it as a divide and conquer problem and also recognized the dynamic programming pattern. Though the divide and conquer solution was space-efficient, it took time to implement. The DP version is conceptually similar but uses an array to store previous results.
