#60 Days of Code 💻🔥

Welcome to my **60 Days of Code** challenge! For the next 60 days, I’ll be committing code daily to sharpen my problem-solving, improve consistency, and build stronger habits as a programmer.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Solve at least **1 coding problem** daily (mainly from LeetCode).
- Practice **DSA**, explore **algorithms**, and revisit **fundamentals**.
- Document insights and learnings along the way.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

- Each day has its own folder: `day-1`, `day-2`, ..., `day-60`.
- Every folder includes:
  - **Code solutions**
  - A `README.md` with a table of problems, topics, and links.
  - My personal **notes & learnings** for the day.

---

## 📬 Disclaimer

Some LeetCode solutions were originally written as function-only templates. In this repo, I've expanded and completed them with `main` functions to make them standalone and compilable.

Thanks for visiting! 🚀
