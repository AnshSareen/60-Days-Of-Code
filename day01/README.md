### ðŸ“˜ Notes & Learnings

- Learned the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** for the first time. I was initially solving `Count Primes` inefficiently, but discovering this algorithm helped me approach the problem optimally.
- Revised **Binary Search** through the `Search Insert Position` problem â€” reinforced key patterns and edge-case handling.
- The `Rotate Array` problem required some deeper thought. I challenged myself to optimize it using reversal instead of auxiliary space or brute force.
- For the daily challenge `Distribute Candies`, I had to revise and apply **combinatorics** â€” specifically the **stars and bars** concept, and how it adapts when there's a **restriction per group**.
- For `Squares of a Sorted Array`, I explored how squaring sorted numbers changes their order. Although I used sorting post-squaring, I now realize it could be optimized further using two pointers to avoid sorting.
