### 📘 Notes & Learnings

- This problem involved simulating a robot that processes characters and prints them in lexicographically smallest order using a **stack**.
- I used a helper array `minFrom[i]` to store the index of the smallest character from position `i` to the end.
- At each step, I greedily pushed characters to a stack until the current minimum was at the top or ready to print.
- The core challenge was managing the condition when to stop pushing and start popping.
- Manual stack operations (push/pop) and understanding character comparison logic were key.

- As always, each solution here is extended into a **complete, runnable C program** with `main()` for clarity and local testing.  
📌 **Note:** The original LeetCode problems only require implementing a specific function.
