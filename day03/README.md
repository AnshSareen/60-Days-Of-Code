### ðŸ“˜ Notes & Learnings

- `Teemo Attacking` was a simple simulation problemâ€”solved it very quickly by handling overlaps properly.
- `Assign Cookies` was a clever greedy brain teaserâ€”definitely good for warming up logic and learning how sorting aids minimal satisfaction conditions.
- `Majority Element II` was **very challenging**. After trying hard, I checked discussions and discovered it uses a **modified Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**. Once I understood it, I implemented the logic myself confidently.
- `Max Candies from Boxes` had an intuitive approach, but required careful thinking. Using arrays to track opened boxes and collected keys made it manageable. The `changed` flag was important to make sure we loop until no new boxes are openedâ€”especially in edge cases like nested keys from box 999 to 0.
