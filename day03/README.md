### üìò Notes & Learnings

- `Teemo Attacking` was a simple simulation problem‚Äîsolved it quickly by accounting for time overlaps.
- `Assign Cookies` was a great greedy brain teaser‚Äîsorting both arrays really helped simplify logic.
- `Majority Element II` was **tough**. After multiple attempts, I learned it requires a modified **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**. Once understood, I rewrote it myself.
- `Max Candies from Boxes` was an intuitive implementation puzzle. Tracking opened boxes, collected keys, and looping with a `changed` flag helped ensure no box was missed ‚Äî especially in edge cases with nested keys like box 999 down to 0.

- As always, each solution here is extended into a **complete, runnable C program** with `main()` for clarity and local testing.  
üìå **Note:** The original LeetCode problems only require implementing a specific function.
