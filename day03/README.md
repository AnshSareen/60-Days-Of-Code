### üìò Notes & Learnings

- `Teemo Attacking`  was a simple simulation problem‚Äîsolved it very quickly by handling overlaps properly.
- `Assign Cookies`was a clever greedy brain teaser‚Äîdefinitely good for warming up logic and learning how sorting aids minimal satisfaction conditions.
- `Majority Element II`was very challenging. After trying hard, I checked discussions and discovered it uses a modified Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm. Once I understood it, I implemented the logic myself confidently.
- `Max Candies from Boxes` had an easy core idea, but the **implementation order mattered**. I learned to track opened boxes using a `bool` array and handle cycles or deep chaining (like box 999 unlocking box 998... down to box 0) using a `changed` flag loop ‚Äî this guaranteed we consumed all reachable boxes and keys.

- As always, each solution here is extended into a **complete, runnable C program** with `main()` for clarity and local testing.  
üìå **Note:** The original LeetCode problems only require implementing a specific function.
